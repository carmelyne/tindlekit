# Tindlekit â€” MVP

This is the proof-of-concept / MVP repository for **Tindlekit**, an open platform to surface and support bold ideas of all kinds â€” from open-source projects and community initiatives to films, educational resources, and creative works.

## Collaboration & Development

Carmelyne Thompson Ã— ChatGPT 5 Ã— Claude Code Sonnet 4 â€” HITL Collaboration

This project was built through a Human-In-The-Loop workflow, pairing Carmelyne Thompson with two AI coding partners â€” ChatGPT 5 and Claude Code Sonnet 4 â€” to design, implement, and test features end-to-end.

We worked against a defined Product Requirements Document (PRD), guided by task lists and structured prompts (see /docs, PRD.md, TASKS.md, and prompt-for-tests-agent.md). Development included:

- Schema and migration updates
- Frontend & backend integration
- Security hardening (Cloudflare Turnstile)
- Unit & E2E testing suites
- CI/CD workflow in GitHub Actions

HITL Process Highlights

- PRD reviewed and refined with human oversight
- Implementation steps validated against acceptance criteria
- Automated tests authored and run in-loop until green
- Migration scripts aligned with API contracts
- Documentation updated alongside commits

## Documentation

Full documentation can be found in the [`docs/`](./docs) directory:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` â€” High-level system design
- `CONTRIBUTORS.md` â€” Project contributors
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` â€” How to deploy the project
- `HOW_TO_VIBECODE.md` â€” Guide for Level 2 vibe coding
- `LLM_PROMPTS.md` â€” Prompt engineering and LLM usage reference
- `PHILOSOPHY.md` â€” The guiding philosophy of the project

ðŸ“‹ Planning & Development Docs

- PRD-v2.md â€” Latest product requirements document for the MVP, including feature scope, acceptance criteria, and design updates.
- PRD.md â€” Original product requirements document for the earliest concept and design planning.
- TASKS.md â€” Development task tracker with feature breakdowns, priorities, and progress notes.
- TEST.md â€” Manual and automated testing guidelines, including instructions for running unit and end-to-end tests.

## Prompts & Agent Workflow

This project used a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop approach.
Two dedicated prompt files guided each AI agentâ€™s responsibilities:

- `prompt-for-tests-agent.md` â€” Defines the scope, style, and coverage for automated tests.
- `prompt-for-ui-agent.md` â€” Outlines UI/UX goals, component specs, and accessibility requirements.

Both prompts are part of the reproducible build process. They define the agent-specific responsibilities that were followed during development, ensuring consistent outputs even when re-run by different AI systems. By keeping them versioned in the repo, other contributors can adapt or extend the same workflows without losing the original intent.
