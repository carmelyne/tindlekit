## üèóÔ∏è Backend Development Prompts

### API Endpoint Development

```
I'm building "Tindlekit - Inspired by The Andrej Effect" - a lightweight token-based idea funding platform.

Context from PRD:
- PHP backend with SQLite/MySQL
- Must run on shared hosting (vanilla PHP, no frameworks)
- Simple token voting system with üçÄ emojis
- Goal: anyone can fork and deploy in 15 minutes

I need help implementing: [SPECIFIC_ENDPOINT]

Requirements:
- Clean, readable PHP code
- Proper error handling with JSON responses
- SQLite-compatible queries
- Security best practices for shared hosting

Current database schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE ideas (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  votes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

Please provide the complete PHP code with error handling and testing suggestions.

```

### Database Schema Optimization
```

I'm designing a minimal database for "Tindlekit - Inspired by The Andrej Effect" idea voting platform.

Requirements:

- SQLite for easy deployment
- Support idea submissions with title/description
- Token-based voting (üçÄ counts)
- Optional: user sessions, moderation flags
- Keep it simple - single developer can deploy in 15 minutes

Current schema:
[PASTE_CURRENT_SCHEMA]

Please suggest:

1. Schema improvements for better performance
2. Indexes for common queries
3. Migration strategy for updates
4. Sample data for testing

Focus on shared hosting compatibility and simplicity.

```

### PHP Configuration & Security
```

I'm deploying "The Andrej Effect" to shared hosting. Need help with:

1. .htaccess configuration for clean URLs
2. PHP security best practices
3. Rate limiting for voting endpoints
4. CORS handling for frontend-backend communication

Platform constraints:

- Vanilla PHP (no composer/frameworks)
- SQLite database
- Static frontend files
- Must be fork-friendly and educational

Please provide complete configuration files with comments explaining each security measure.

- POST /backend/routes/add-idea.php (create new idea)

Requirements:

1. Fetch and display ideas dynamically
2. Handle token voting with optimistic UI updates
3. Add new idea form with validation
4. Error handling and user feedback
5. Simple animations for vote interactions

Please provide:

- Complete main.js with modern ES6+ features

## üöÄ Deployment & DevOps Prompts

### Shared Hosting Deployment
```

I need to deploy "Tindlekit - Inspired by The Andrej Effect" platform to shared hosting (like cPanel/Bluehost).

Stack:

- PHP backend with SQLite
- Static HTML/CSS/JS frontend
- No frameworks or complex build processes
- Goal: 15-minute deployment for anyone

Please provide:
