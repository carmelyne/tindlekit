# How to Vibe Code

Welcome to **Tindlekit - Inspired by The Andrej Effect: Vibe Coding Level 2**.
This guide teaches you how to build from a **PRD + task list**, not ad-hoc prompts. Vibe coding is collaborative, playful, and structured.

---

## 1️⃣ The Core Idea

Vibe coding is about **energy + flow + focus**:

- **Energy:** Keep contributions small, positive, fast.
- **Flow:** Build from PRDs and shared goals.
- **Focus:** Stay on tasks, vibe off each other’s commits.

---

## 2️⃣ Steps to Start

1. **Clone the Repo**

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd tindlekit
   ```

2. **Read the PRD**
   Understand the vision before touching code.
3. **Pick a Task**
   Open `tasks.md` and choose an open task.
4. **Vibe Commit**
   - Keep changes small.
   - Use friendly commit messages (e.g., `🍀 added token counter`).
5. **Push + Share**
   Open a PR and keep the vibe flowing.

---

## 3️⃣ Vibe Rules

- No harsh reviews. Feedback = playful + helpful.
- PRD is the source of truth.
- Keep tokens meaningful, not just code—they represent support and ideas.

---

## 4️⃣ Learn Level 2 Vibe Coding

Level 2 means:

- Working from **shared product thinking**, not isolated commands.
- Passing context via **PRDs and tasks**, not just chat prompts.
- Treating commits as **signals**, not just code drops.

🍀 _Let's make idea funding fun and open-source. Build small. Ship fast. Vibe always._

## 📈 Complete Dev Cycle Roadmap

**For developers learning structured development - follow this roadmap to master Level 2 vibe coding!**

### **🗓️ Phase 1: Foundation** (Week 1 - Understanding)

**Goal:** Understand the product before touching code

- [ ] **Day 1-2: Product Immersion**
  - Read PRD.md completely (understand vision, not just features)
  - Study TASKS.md and pick your vibe level
  - Set up local development environment
  - Join community discussions about the product direction

- [ ] **Day 3-4: Technical Foundation**
  - Implement database schema from scratch
  - Create static frontend mockup (no backend yet)
  - Write your first "vibe commit" with friendly message
  - Document any PRD questions or clarifications needed

- [ ] **Day 5-7: Core Understanding**
  - Build one complete user flow manually (idea → vote → display)
  - Test with sample data and edge cases
  - Review other contributors' code for patterns
  - Update documentation based on your learning

**🎯 Success Metrics:** You can explain the product vision to someone else, local environment works perfectly

---

### **🚀 Phase 2: MVP Development** (Week 2 - Building)

**Goal:** Build the minimum viable experience

- [ ] **Day 8-10: Backend Core**
  - Implement all three API endpoints (get-ideas, post-vote, add-idea)
  - Add proper error handling and validation
  - Test endpoints with Postman or curl
  - Create API documentation for other contributors

- [ ] **Day 11-12: Frontend Integration**
  - Connect frontend to backend with fetch() calls
  - Handle loading states and error messages
  - Add basic token emoji interactions (🍀🪙)
  - Test the complete user flow

- [ ] **Day 13-14: Polish & Testing**
  - Implement basic styling with playful token theme
  - Add form validation and user feedback
  - Test on different devices and browsers
  - Write tests or manual testing checklist

**🎯 Success Metrics:** A friend can submit an idea, vote, and see results - the core loop works

---

### **🎨 Phase 3: Polish & Deploy** (Week 3 - Shipping)

**Goal:** Make it production-ready and accessible

- [ ] **Day 15-17: Deployment Preparation**
  - Create deployment guide for shared hosting
  - Set up .htaccess and proper file structure
  - Test deployment process on actual hosting service
  - Document any hosting-specific issues and solutions

- [ ] **Day 18-19: Performance & Security**
  - Add rate limiting for voting endpoints
  - Implement basic security measures (input sanitization, CORS)
  - Optimize database queries and add indexes
  - Test under realistic load conditions

- [ ] **Day 20-21: Admin Features** (Optional)
  - Build simple admin interface for idea moderation
  - Add export functionality (CSV/JSON)
  - Create backup and maintenance procedures
  - Document admin workflows

**🎯 Success Metrics:** Platform is live, secure, and others can fork/deploy in 15 minutes

---

### **🌟 Phase 4: Community & Growth** (Week 4 - Scaling)

**Goal:** Build sustainable community and processes

- [ ] **Day 22-24: Documentation Excellence**
  - Create comprehensive contributor guidelines
  - Write troubleshooting guides for common issues
  - Record video tutorials for key workflows
  - Set up issue templates and PR guidelines

- [ ] **Day 25-26: Community Building**
  - Share your fork/customization story
  - Help newcomers through issues and PRs
  - Organize virtual "vibe coding" sessions
  - Create showcase of funded ideas and success stories

- [ ] **Day 27-28: Innovation & Feedback**
  - Gather user feedback and analyze usage patterns
  - Prototype next-level features (mobile responsiveness, notifications)
  - Contribute improvements back to main repository
  - Mentor other developers through the roadmap

**🎯 Success Metrics:** You're helping others succeed, community is growing, ideas are getting funded

## 🎯 Learning Checkpoints

**After Phase 1:** "I understand product requirements and can set up development environments"
**After Phase 2:** "I can build complete features from requirements to working code"
**After Phase 3:** "I can deploy and maintain production applications"
**After Phase 4:** "I can lead technical projects and mentor other developers"

## 🛠️ Daily Vibe Coding Practices

**Morning Ritual** (10 minutes)

- Review yesterday's commits and any feedback
- Check PRD for alignment with current work
- Pick one small task for the day
- Set intention: "Today I will..."

**Coding Sessions** (2-3 hours focused blocks)

- Write code in small, testable chunks
- Make frequent commits with descriptive messages
- Take breaks to review and refactor
- Ask for help early when stuck

**Evening Reflection** (10 minutes)

- Document what you learned
- Update task status and next steps
- Share progress with community
- Celebrate small wins

## 🤝 Collaborative Development Patterns

### The "Vibe Handoff"

When working with others:

1. **Context Transfer:** Share PRD section + current task
2. **Code Tour:** Explain key decisions and architecture
3. **Test Together:** Verify functionality works as expected
4. **Document Changes:** Update docs and comments
5. **Positive Feedback:** Celebrate what works well

### The "Learning Loop"

For every feature built:

1. **Research:** What similar solutions exist?
2. **Design:** How does this fit the PRD vision?
3. **Build:** Implement with clean, commented code
4. **Test:** Verify it works and handles edge cases
5. **Reflect:** What did you learn? How to improve?
6. **Share:** Document insights for future contributors
